# GWord-Music version

## Introduction

- This is a game made by unity3D engine, and this game is a parody of The New York Times "wordle" implementation, but the developer is free to change the vocabulary data they want to use, and there is a full scoreboard.
- The current vocabulary used is from the **music dictionary**.
- It's only for practice, absolutely no commercial use...

## How To build

- This project was compiled and built using Unity 2019.4.36f1 (64-bit).

- After building, please copy the Assets folder, which contains **only** the File folder, to the built folder so that it can run properly. **(Important!)**

### Vocabulary

- The vocabulary used in this project is obtained from the music dictionary.
- There are **490** words in total.
- The vocabulary database retrieves all five-letter words from the music dictionary that do not contain abbreviations, including names, pieces, dramas, musical terms, and so on, so this game is a bit difficult!

## How To Play

- Like wordle, you can try six times in one game, clicking or pressing enter to send your guesses, and each guess must be a valid 5-letter word, after each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

### Example

- The letter **M** is in the word and in the correct spot.

- The letter **O** is in the word but in the wrong spot.

- Finally, enjoy your game!
